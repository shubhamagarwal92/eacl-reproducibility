Using a survey, in which we involve members of the NLP community, we investigate how our community perceives this topic, its relevance and options for improvement. Based on over two hundred participants, the survey results confirm earlier observations, that successful reproducibility requires more than having access to code and data. Additionally, the results show that the topic has to be tackled from the authors’, reviewers’ and community’s side.",,

This paper codifies model and task agnostic principles for informative error analysis, and presents Errudite, an interactive tool for better supporting this process. First, error groups should be precisely defined for reproducibility; Errudite supports this with an expressive domain-specific language. Second, to avoid spurious conclusions, a large set of instances should be analyzed, including both positive and negative examples; Errudite enables systematic grouping of relevant instances with filtering queries. Third, hypotheses about the cause of errors should be explicitly tested; Errudite supports this via automated counterfactual rewriting. We validate our approach with a user study, finding that Errudite (1) enables users to perform high quality and reproducible error analyses with less effort, (2) reveals substantial ambiguities in prior published error analyses practices, and (3) enhances the error analysis experience by allowing users to test and revise prior beliefs.",,

The two standard datasets for this task were collected using Google searches for news reports on given events. Not only is this IR method not reproducible at different search times, it also uses components (such as document popularity) that are not always available for any large news corpus. It is unclear how TLS algorithms fare when provided with event corpora collected with varying IR methods. We therefore construct event-specific corpora from a large static background corpus, the newsroom dataset, using differing, relatively simple IR methods based on raw text alone. We show that the choice of IR method plays a crucial role in the performance of various TLS algorithms. A weak TLS algorithm can even match a stronger one by employing a stronger IR method in the data collection phase. Furthermore, the results of TLS systems are often highly sensitive to additional sentence filtering. We consequently advocate for integrating IR into the development of TLS systems and having a common static background corpus for evaluation of TLS systems.",,

This paper reports on the scientific reproduction of several systems addressing the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task of SemEval2018. Given a recent publication that pointed out spurious statistical cues in the data set used in the shared task, and that produced a revised version of it, we also evaluated the reproduced systems with this new data set. The exercise reported here shows that, in general, the reproduction of these systems is successful with scores in line with those reported in SemEval2018. However, the performance scores are worst than those, and even below the random baseline, when the reproduced systems are run over the revised data set expunged from data artifacts. This demonstrates that this task is actually a much harder challenge than what could have been perceived from the inflated, close to human-level performance scores obtained with the data set used in SemEval2018. This calls for a revival of this task as there is much room for improvement until systems may come close to the upper bound provided by human performance.",,

","Khoe, Yung Han",Reproducing a Morphosyntactic Tagger with a Meta-{B}i{LSTM} Model over Context Sensitive Token Encodings,Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,2020,LREC,"Reproducibility is generally regarded as being a requirement for any form of experimental science. Even so, reproduction of research results is only recently beginning to be practiced and acknowledged. In the context of the REPROLANG 2020 shared task, we contribute to this trend by reproducing the work reported on by Bohnet et al. (2018) on morphosyntactic tagging. Their meta-BiLSTM model achieved state-of-the-art results across a wide range of languages. This was done by integrating sentence-level and single-word context through synchronized training by a meta-model. Our reproduction only partially confirms the main results of the paper in terms of outperforming earlier models. The results of our reproductions improve on earlier models on the morphological tagging task, but not on the part-of-speech tagging task. Furthermore, even where we improve on earlier models, we fail to match the F1-scores reported for the meta-BiLSTM model. Because we chose not to contact the original authors for our reproduction study, the uncertainty about the degree of parallelism that was achieved between the original study and our reproduction limits the value of our findings as an assessment of the reliability of the original results. At the same time, however, it underscores the relevance of our reproduction effort in regard to the reproducibility and interpretability of those findings. The discrepancies between our findings and the original results demonstrate that there is room for improvement in many aspects of reporting regarding the reproducibility of the experiments. In addition, we suggest that different reporting choices could improve the interpretability of the results.",,
